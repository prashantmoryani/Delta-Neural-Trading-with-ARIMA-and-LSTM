# Delta-Neutral-Trading-with-ARIMA-and-LSTM
This repository contains a comprehensive framework for implementing delta-neutral trading strategies using advanced time series forecasting techniques, specifically ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.
# Overview 
Delta-neutral trading aims to construct a portfolio where the delta (sensitivity to underlying asset price changes) is balanced, minimizing exposure to market movements. This strategy can be enhanced with precise forecasting of asset prices or price spreads, which is where ARIMA and LSTM models come into play.
# Features
>ARIMA Model Implementation: Time series forecasting using ARIMA for short to medium-term predictions. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

>LSTM Neural Network: Leveraging deep learning with LSTM to capture complex patterns in time series data for more accurate long-term predictions.

>Delta-Neutral Strategy Application: Integrate the forecasts from ARIMA and LSTM models to design and simulate delta-neutral trading strategies.

>Backtesting Framework: Evaluate strategy performance with historical data, including key metrics such as Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and overall profitability.

>Data Preprocessing: Tools for cleaning, normalizing, and preparing financial data for model training.

>Visualization Tools: Plotting utilities for analyzing model predictions, trading signals, and strategy performance.
